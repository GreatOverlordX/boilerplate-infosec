# Information Security with HelmetJS

This is the boilerplate for the Information Security lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/


## My Experience:

I learned how to mount different helmet.js middlewares through the **freeCodeCamp** *helmet.js* infosec challenges

---- 

Although it is suggested to not remove anything from the server.js side, I simply edited some minimal stuff such as `var`, changing for `const` and `let`.

### Optional

At some point you get to do some *'parent'* helmet() middleware instead of the single helmet functions; i.e`app.use(helmet.middleware());`. 
Hence I decided to go with the *'parent'* **helmet() middleware** instead.

### ???

Something is hiding at plain sight, I was bored so I `tinkered` it for **fun**.
